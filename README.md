This study explores the potential of artificial intelligence-assisted mammography to improve breast cancer detection while acknowledging the challenges to its widespread adoption. Even though artificial intelligence has many benefits, such as increased efficiency and accuracy, problems involving transparency, generalizability, and data diversity are crucial. By prioritizing interpretable AI systems, robust external validation, and a variety of training datasets, the paper emphasizes the necessity of a collaborative approach to integrating AI into clinical practice. Artificial intelligence has the potential to significantly impact breast cancer screening's precision, accessibility, and effectiveness with careful application and continued research, leading to better patient outcomes and a more equitable healthcare system.
